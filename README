What does your program do?
- Given a set of input points, it finds a subset of the centerpoint region.

How do I get it to run?
- There will be a button to execute the algorithm and you just click on it.

What is the input?
- The input is a finite number of points.

How does the basic algorithm work?
- Do the algorithm presented in class. It's basically a series of Ham-Sandwich cuts that will produce the centerpoint region.
